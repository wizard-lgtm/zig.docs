# zig.docs

## A collection of good documentation and examples of Ziglang.

## Introduction
### 'Your path trought to be a ziglang master'
Ziglang is an a really amazing programming language. But the documentation of ziglang is kinda basic and giving you not so much examples. (For example check out here:)

So my goal is creating the best educative ziglang documentation ever created. Some of textes are directly copied from ziglang.org offical documentation or any other resources. You can check references section at the bottom of the post.
